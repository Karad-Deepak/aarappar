      "We (a couple with a small child) had dinner at Aarappar this evening. The opening offer was a buffet. We really liked it there. The restaurant is cozy, the food was delicious and the service was great. Everyone was very warm and understanding, especially towards our child. We felt comfortable and will definitely come back.",

    review:
      "Recently visited the newest Indian restaurant in town with authentic Indian cuisine. The price was reasonable, especially considering the variety and quality of the food. Itâ€™s a great option for trying a little bit of everything Indian cuisine has to offer both veg & non-veg. Overall, this restaurant is perfect for those looking to explore a range of Indian flavors in one visit. Definitely recommended",
